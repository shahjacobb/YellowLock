# YellowLock - A real time chat messaging application

**YellowLock** (inspired by'연락' in korean, aka "communication" or "contact") is a chat messaging application built entirely on top of AWS serverless services. It utilizes API Gateway for a unified web API, and also utilizes WebSockets for real-time, two way communication. 

I always had a huge interest in using WebSockets and wanted to leverage my experience with AWS working on [Lumix](https://github.com/shahjacobb/Lumix) in something that people could use.

API Gateway actually has pretty darn good support for WebSockets, so the documentation wasn't *super* hard to get through.
